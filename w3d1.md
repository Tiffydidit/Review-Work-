##Notes and discoveries in week three

#DOM Questions/ W3 D1

THOUGHT: Can you use JS on the DOM to change "pages" by creating an object constructor, using the "new" keyword to create several objects i.e. "pages", then calling each object onclick of buttons in the nav/ or creating methods for each object that when called on click display the object in the DOM...

What is radix? 

We need to work on nesting: nesting loops, nesting fuctions, nesting arrays, nesting objects; following control flow and accesing info in the latter two. (These are listed from easiet to most difficult)

ternary operators are a bit of a confusion...

#Week 3 day 2.
Worked on callback and higher order functions in codesmith. (Functional programming)
Finsished Basic JS in freecode camp yesterday and am moving on to functional programming.

I find functional programming a bit easier to digest and execute at the moment. Because I started out with objects and am still slowly coming to understanding, I'm going to finish functional prograaming, then circle back to objects.
