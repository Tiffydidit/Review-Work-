		<h2 class="heads">Linguistic Indoctrination</h2>
		<div>
			<div>
			<p>The first step in colonial, human programming is linguistic indoctrination.  After a person or group has been indoctrinated into the language of an oppressor, this language, that is not their own and in many ways can be considered malware, is used by the oppressor to define everything, including the identities of those being oppressed. These colonizer curated identities, characteristics, desires are scripts, that grant the colonizer control of the masses. 

			Consider that many colonized, indigenous people everywhere speak of even freedom in the language of their oppressor: Dutch, English, French, Portuguese, Spanish.  Now, imagine if every computer in the world each recognized a different language; passing information between machines would be rife with tedium, nearly impossible, and certainly not as addictive/fun. Like computer programming languages, linguistic indoctrination makes all types of human programming possible.

			<div class="fp pefp">

					<p>
					Psychological eugenics, maybe the most important tenant of colonization, as it's a dynamic means of propagating self-loathing; which in turn, leads to self-destruction or the desire to be included in a system sustained by ones destruction. </p>

					<p>Psychological eugenics teaches all people being oppressed by colonization to internalize its tenants and erase themselves. In this way, the system does not need to actively oppress anyone, but simply embed the programming and allow it to run -- just as a web developer needs only to write a program and allow a mechanical computer to run the script. </p>

					<p>Psychological eugenics is a code embedded in the populous through a homogenized "education" system and various forms of media (literature, music, theatre, film, television) that programs peoples standards and values to that of their oppressor. This code runs perpetually in an infinite loop, until the system dies; if not met by an exit condition like R.<span class="oic">o.i.</span>. Asforementoned, Linguistic indoctrination makes all types of human programming possible --it's the organic equivalent of Javascript; Psychological eugenics is the organic equivalent of a JS function, that makes it almost effortless, once programmed.</p>

					<p>At it's most basic level, Psychological eugenics programs entire human populations to make unnecessary, and often, harmful physical modifications to their bodies and surroundings e.g. and lawns. Higher order Psychological eugenics programs populations to eat poison, trust the system feeding them poison to help them cultivate life, and even breed their own genetic identities out of existence; turning procreation into anti-creation.</p>

		<h1 class="sub">Base Identity</h1>

		<h2 class="heads">Blackness</h2>
		<div class="fp">
			<img class="colib"   src="../images/black.gif" >
			<div>
				<p>Black is a term/identity created by Eurasian colonizers to erase the tribal identities of indigenous peoples; making it easier to reprogram their standards, practices, and values to that of the colonizer. </p>
				<p>This identity has been programmed to recognize the value of anything beyond monetary gain. As money is a construct used to to trade life, space, and time for what is essentially not real; these are beings with no loyalty to reality. </p>
				<p></p>

		</div>
		<h2 class="heads">Whiteness</h2>
		<div class="fp">
			<img class="coli" src="../images/white.gif">
			<div>
				<p>Subsequently, white is a term/identity created to control the Eurasian populace effected by Isms unrelated to race: classism, sexism, heterosexism, etc. Whiteness indoctrinates exploited, Eurasians into the belief that other exploited people are their adversary and not the very system that thrives on their poverty and miseducation. </p>
				<p>This identity also does not recognize the value of life, beyond monetary gain. As money is a construct used to to trade life, space, and time for what is essentially not real; these are also beings with no loyalty to reality.</p>

		<h1 class="sub">Illusions</h1>
		<h2 class="heads">Choices</h2>
		<div>
			<div>
				<p>People are not colors. We all are, however, products of continental relationships i.e. relationships with lands to which we are indigenous. R.<span class="oic">o.i.</span> proposes that humans belong to the land and the reversal of that relationship has helped colonization consume their identities.</p>

				<p> All people that identify as black/white and all human colors created by this system are at their foundation, the same. They have been programmed to assimilate to a system of destruction and aid it by any means neccessary. Isms create levels of participation and benefit, that create the illusion of choice, however, the basic life-cycle within colonization is: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Be indoctrinated</li> 
						<li>Work toward the benefit of the colonial system</li> 
							<ul>
								<li>If you have children, indoctrinate them.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Be paid for your service</li>
						<li>Die</li>
					</ul> 

				<p> Whether one is a banker or a barber, a convict or a scientist this is life. </p>
