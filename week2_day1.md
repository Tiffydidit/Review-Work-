#Notes for next week.

##This a makeup for last week.




Take an image of the bills and have them display on the dom in correspondence to the amount of each type of currency.

body.append?

form to run register function. The arguments are being passed from the inputs input.value.  


All we're doing is using a form to pass an argument to our moneyBack function that already exists in "functions_while_loops", running the function onclick in the submit button of the form, and rendering bills onto the DOM w/ the result.


index.html = a form and an empty div underneath. 

inner.html to diplay bills in empty div. 







##This is week two.
