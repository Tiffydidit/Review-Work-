## Week 1, Day 1

We went over javascript basics, like loop counters and catchers. 

We also went over (+=, -=, \*=, /= and how they work.

I discovered how functions, loops, and conditionals work together. 

functions can store loops, conditions, and other statements as well as pass information to them.
