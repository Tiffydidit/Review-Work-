		<h1 class="heads">Indoctrination</h1>
		<div>

			<p>The first step in colonial, human programming is linguistic indoctrination. Linguistic indoctrination makes of human programming possible. After a person or group has been indoctrinated into the language of an oppressor, this language, that is not their own and in many ways can be considered malware, is used by the oppressor to define everything, including the identities of the oppressed. These colonizer curated identities, characteristics, desires are scripts, that grant the colonizer control of the masses. 

			Consider that many colonized, indigenous people everywhere speak of even freedom in the language of their oppressor: Dutch, English, French, Portuguese, Spanish.  Now, imagine if every computer in the world each recognized a different language; passing information between machines would be rife with tedium, nearly impossible, and certainly not as addictive/fun.

			<div>
				<p>Black is a term/identity created by Eurasian colonizers to erase the tribal identities of indigenous peoples; making it easier to reprogram their standards, practices, and values to that of the colonizer. </p>
				<p>Beings with no loyalty to reality. </p>

		<h2 class="top">Whiteness</h2>
		<div>
			<a href="#"><img class="coli" src="../images/white.gif"></a>
			<div>
				<p>Subsequently, White is a term/identity created to control the Eurasian populace effected by Isms unrelated to race: classism, sexism, heterosexism, etc. Whiteness indoctrinates exploited, Eurasians into the belief that other exploited people are their adversary and not the very system that thrives on their poverty and miseducation. </p>

			Psychological eugenics, maybe the most important tenant of colonization, as it's a dynamic means of propagating self-loathing; which in turn, leads to self-destruction. 

			Psychological eugenics teaches all people being oppressed by colonization to internalize it's tenants and erase themselves. In this way, the system does not need to actively oppress anyone, but simply embed the programming and allow it to run -- just as a web developer needs only to write a program and allow a mechanical computer to run the script. 

			Psychological eugenics is a code embedded in the populous through a homogenized learning system and the media: literature, music, theatre, film, television; and runs perpetually in an infinite loop, until the system dies; if not met by an exit condition like ROI. Asforementoned, Linguistic indoctrination makes all types of human programming possible --it's the organic equivalent of Javascript, and Psychological eugenics, the organic equivalent of functions, makes it nearly effortless. Imagine if every computer in the world each recognized a different language; passing information between machines would be rife with tedium, nearly impossible, and certainly not as addictive/fun. This is why Lingusitic indoctrination is neccessary.

			At it's most basic level, Psychological eugenics programs entire human populations to make unnecessary physical modifications to their bodies and surroundings e.g. and lawns. Higher order Psychological eugenics programs populations to eat poison, trust the system feeding them poison to help them cultivate life, and even breed their own genetic identities out of existence; turning procreation into anti-creation.
