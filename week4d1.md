##Week 4 Notes

#These notes are all thoughts and feelings:

Kai has kinda disappeared mysteriously and I a little worreid about her. 

I'm also more than a little worrid about myself.. What anI doing with my life?

I don't know how well this coding thing is going and I'm not sure where my life goes from here. I thought thirty would be this stellar year, and thus far it's just been disappointment and WTF. Surprisingly enough, my class at the library is going very well. 

Belem is an awesome instructor and I'm getting so much better at css. Wokepedia is going together well too, I just need to find the motivation to do it. I honestly need to find the motivation to do anything - I haven't showered in idk how many days.

I think the universe is trying to teach me how to be content and gratful when things are not coming up roses, especially when things are not coming up roses. 

I need to get back to my daily grind. Tomorrow is a new day and I'm leaving these gross, depressed feelings behind.
