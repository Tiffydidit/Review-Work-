## Notes for week 5

I have to decide between meeting one of the co-founders of iota or going to hackfest on time and I'm a little shook. 

I am invested in iota and have been since mid 2017, it would be great to meet one of the creators.

JS for kids is great and Troy gave me a lot of things to work on. 

I'm just doing something everynight to keep myself in the game. 

I've learned some SQL and am solidifying my knowledge of objects.

I'm thinking of pitching WadGod at Hackfest.

Things are going well, I just have to stay focused. 

Projects:

	R.O.I.

	Wokepedia

	SafeSpace

	WadGod


I just took the fullstack exam. I only solved 2/6 problems -- everything else required a knowledge of methods that I did not have.

Graduation from the library course is on the 15th and I made it, yay!

I don't kow if this is a real career for me or I'm just learning this sotht when I can afford to have my app made, I can't be cheated/know who to hire.

Right now: Laeeq, Cai
