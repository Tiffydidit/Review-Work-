			<p>R.<span class="oic">o.i.</span> (Renouncing Our Isms) recognizes that human beings are organic computers, that function perfectly when they learn how to take care of themselves; and that colonization and subsequently, industrialization, are tools used to divert humanity's progression toward Life. (Note: there is a difference between Life and survival).</p>
			<p>Like mechanical computers, humans too, can be programmed. R.<span class="oic">o.i.</span> proposes that the modern human has been programmed by colonization, to operate against it's own best interest - as an autoimmune disease, of sorts, to all life i.e. destroyers; and works in an effort to reprogram humanity as facilitators of life, i.e creators, by depicting the foundational flaws of our current programming and offering practical alternatives.</p> 
			<p>However, R.<span class="oic">o.i.</span> is not a testament to colonization and will not reiterate the history we were all indoctrinated into by the so-called education system. We all know the tale of this system, that even in its white-washed state, is barbaric, brutal, and morally bankrupt. R.<span class="oic">o.i</span>. posits that awareness of the programming is the first step of de/reprogramming; for that reason the tenants of colonization must be discussed.  </p>

			<h4>What are Isms?</h4>
			<h5>Why are they worth renouncing?</h5>
			<p>Isms are  divisive thought processes used by oppressors to marginalize and exploit. Conversely, the exploited typically use isms to gain access to systems built on and sustained by their oppression and exploitation. R.<span class="oic">o.i.</span> posits that people have been programmed to identify with isms as a firewall against revolution. In other words, when the exploited/excluded are working to be included within the oppressive regime, they are not working to dismantle it. </p>
